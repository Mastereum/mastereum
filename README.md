# Mastereum

The concept of Mastereum is to combine Ethereum smart contracts with DASH-Masternode style voting.

Additionally, it is intended to be delivered with a management dapp "gobble" that involves assimiliating crypto-collectibles from the main Ethereum chain. Appropriately gobbled collectibles then become the basis for the masternode decision making. Additional goals are to do this with zero premine and some 'equitable' method of dispersing early rewards. 

Consider this a work in progress.
