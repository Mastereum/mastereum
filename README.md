# Mastereum

The concept of Mastereum is to combine Ethereum smart contracts with DASH-Masternode style voting.

Additionally, it is intended to be delivered with a management dapp "gobble" that involves assimiliating crypto-collectibles from the main Ethereum chain. Appropriately gobbled collectibles then become the basis for the masternode decision making.

Consider this a work in progress.
